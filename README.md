# Podcasting Together


## About

Podcasting Together is a mobile application that allows users to browse podcast episodes. The list of suggested shows is tailored to each
specific user based on his/her preferences, friendsâ€™ interests, and watch history. The resulting recommendations are ***devised using the IBM Watson NLP***.


## Licence

The application is a part requirement for the BSc Degree in Computer Science at ***University College London*** and was conducted as part of [***The IBM Academic Initiative***](https://www.ibm.com/academic/home). It is substantially the result of my own work except where explicitly indicated. The code may be freely copied and distributed provided the source is explicitly acknowledged.
